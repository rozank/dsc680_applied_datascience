## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview

This project illustrates a detailed methodology for detecting and preventing credit card fraud using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, which includes transactions from European cardholders in September 2013, the project is structured into three key phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preparation, and Model Building and Evaluation. The initial EDA highlighted the imbalanced nature of the dataset, which informed the data preparation strategy, incorporating feature engineering and oversampling to improve model efficacy. During the evaluation stage, various algorithms were assessed, with a tailored Random Forest model, adjusted for the dataset's imbalance, emerging as the most effective. This model achieved high marks in precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC ROC, demonstrating its robust capability in fraud detection. This project emphasizes the importance of thorough data analysis and preparation in applying machine learning for combating financial fraud, offering insights for the deployment of similar models in practical settings.
