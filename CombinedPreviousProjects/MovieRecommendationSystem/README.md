## Movie Recommendation System

### Overview

This project explores the relationship between NFL game days and the occurrence of arrests in host cities, employing a comprehensive dataset (nflarrests.csv) to analyze various factors such as game outcomes, home vs. away team dynamics, score differences, and whether the game was a divisional match. Utilizing tools and libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn for linear regression analysis, the study aimed to uncover any statistical correlations between the excitement of NFL games and the frequency of arrests. Initial analyses included generating descriptive statistics, creating a heatmap to identify missing data, and employing visualizations like pair plots, bar charts for probability distributions, and cumulative distribution functions to examine the distribution of arrests.

**Data Acquisition**

The foundation of the project was built upon the acquisition of two primary datasets from the GroupLens website: "movies.csv" and "ratings.csv". These datasets encompass comprehensive information on movies, including titles, genres, user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps. Leveraging the pandas library in Python, these datasets were loaded and prepared for the next stages of the project.

**Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is a critical step in ensuring the quality and consistency of the data before analysis. This phase involved several key tasks:

1. Merging Datasets: The "movies.csv" and "ratings.csv" datasets were merged based on the movie ID, creating a unified dataset that links movies with their corresponding ratings.
2. Cleaning Data: The merged dataset was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or missing values, ensuring that only movies with valid ratings were included in the analysis.
3. Handling Multiple Ratings: A check was implemented to identify if a user had rated a movie more than once, though this scenario was not present in our dataset.
   
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA was conducted to gain insights into the dataset and understand the dynamics of movie ratings and user preferences. This involved analyzing the distribution of ratings, identifying the range of ratings (0.5 to 5), and exploring the dataset's structure to inform the choice of the recommendation model.

**Model Selection and Training**

The core of the recommendation system is the collaborative filtering model, implemented using the Surprise library. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm was chosen for its effectiveness in matrix factorization, which is crucial for collaborative filtering. The steps involved were:
1. Preparing the Data: A Reader object was created to parse the dataset with the specified rating scale (0.5 to 5).
2. Splitting the Dataset: The data was divided into training and testing sets to ensure the model could be evaluated accurately.
3. Training the Model: The SVD algorithm was trained on the training set, tuning it to predict user preferences based on historical ratings.
   
**Recommendation Generation**

Upon training, the model was ready to generate personalized movie recommendations. This process entailed:
1. User Input: Prompting the user to enter a movie title.
2. Prediction: The model predicted ratings for all movies in the dataset based on the input title and user preferences.
3. Sorting and Recommendation: Movies were sorted based on the predicted ratings, and the top recommendations were selected for the user.
   
**Result Presentation**

The final step involved presenting the recommended movies to the user. The system displayed the top movies based on the user's input, enhancing the user experience by offering personalized movie suggestions.

**Conclusion**

This methodology outlines a comprehensive approach to developing a personalized movie recommendation system. Each stage, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training and recommendation generation, contributes significantly to the system's effectiveness. By adhering to this methodology, the project not only showcases the potential of data science in entertainment but also provides a scalable solution for personalized content recommendation.
