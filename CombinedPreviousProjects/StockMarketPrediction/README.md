### Overview

In our initial venture into data science, "The Use of Data Mining in Stock Market Predictions," alongside classmates Thanh Nguyen-Duong, Girija Singh, Courtney Sehn, and Tai Ngo, we investigate how Machine Learning and Data Mining can refine stock market forecasting. This collaborative project combines historical stock data, news releases, and advanced algorithms to bolster investment strategies and promote long-term financial growth. We assess the accuracy of these predictive models in the face of market volatility, marking our first step toward mastering data science. This effort aims to provide investors with a robust basis for informed decision-making in the dynamic financial market.
