### OPTIMIZING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT 
#### Advanced Analytics of Facebook Group Posts


**Overview**

This project tackles the challenge of managing an ever-growing volume of posts and discussions in a community Facebook group, which has seen rapid growth from 400 to 700 houses. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we analyze 3,500 posts from the group's inception in March 2022 to derive actionable insights for improving communication and community engagement.


**Key Features**

Automated Data Collection: Utilizes Apify to gather posts and metadata from the Facebook group, focusing on non-personal data.
Advanced Data Preprocessing: Implements rigorous steps to anonymize user identities and prepare textual data for NLP analysis.
In-depth Analysis: Employs NLP and LDA techniques to identify main discussion topics, analyze their evolution, and understand community interests.
Outcome


**Analysis**

A significant growth in unique users, highlighting expanding community engagement.
Concentrated content creation among top users.
Diverse topics of discussion including package delivery issues, local services, infrastructure, and education.


**Future Direction**

The project outlines a roadmap for extending its methodologies to behavioral modeling, content personalization, and community health monitoring. It also suggests adaptability to other social media platforms for a comprehensive community engagement strategy.


**Implementation and Ethical Considerations**

Short-term strategies include awareness campaigns about community interests, with medium-term actions focusing on partnerships with local services. Long-term plans involve enhancing communication channels and tools for moderators. Ethically, the project emphasizes data privacy, bias mitigation, and ensuring diverse representation in data analysis.


**Conclusion**

This project underscores the potential of utilizing advanced analytics to foster social media-based community engagement. By analyzing communication patterns within the Facebook group, it provides a foundational blueprint for enhancing community support and interaction.
