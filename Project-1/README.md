Topic:
“Predicting Startup Funding Success- A Machine Learning Approach”
For this project, a predictive model will be developed to estimate the likelihood of startup
companies receiving funding based on location, industry, and funding history.

Business Problem:
The project will address the uncertainty surrounding the startup funding challenges by predicting
the probability of a startup securing investment. This will assist both investors and startups in
making informed decisions, contributing to the overall success and growth of the startup
ecosystem.

Datasets:
The primary dataset for this project is the 'Startup Investments Crunchbase' from Kaggle. This
dataset contains comprehensive information about startup companies, funding rounds, investors,
and other related details from the Crunchbase platform. Besides, it also encompasses location,
industry, funding history, and other relevant features crucial for predicting funding success.

Methods:
The project will utilize binary classification models to predict whether a startup will likely
receive funding. Logistic regression and decision tree models will be used due to their suitability
for binary classification tasks. In the beginning, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) will also be
conducted to understand patterns and relationships within the data. Feature engineering will be
applied to enhance model performance.

Ethical Considerations:
Potential ethical concerns include biases in the dataset, especially if certain groups or regions are
overrepresented. To address this, the data will be thoroughly reviewed for biases, and
adjustments will be made, if necessary. Additionally, transparency in model decision-making
will be prioritized to ensure fairness and unbiased predictions.

Challenges/Issues:
Challenges may include potential biases in the dataset, data quality issues, and the need for
accurate predictive features. Addressing these challenges will involve careful data preprocessing,
thorough validation of results, and, if necessary, seeking additional data sources to enhance the
analysis.
This proposal provides a concise overview of the project, outlining its objective, the business
problem it addresses, the selected dataset, analysis methods, ethical considerations, potential
challenges, and references for validation.
